CIRCULAR BUFFER

The program aims to calculate the performance of transmitting data between processes using shared memory with circular buffer.
The producer and the client must be launched in two separate shells.
The producer creates 1Mb of random data and reads from a file the size of the data that the user wants to transimt (1Mb to 100Mb).
The producer initialize and creates the shared memory and the semaphores.
The client waits until the producer sends the size and its pid.
At this point, the producer starts writing using the circular buffer communication. The client process reads.
In the shell, the time taken to transmit the whole data is shown.
