NAMED PIPE

The program aims to calculate the performance of transmitting data between processes using named pipes.
The producer creates 1Mb of random data and waits the input from the user (1Mb to 100Mb).
As soon as the input is given, the producer program spawn the child process doing a fork and execvp. During the spawn, the producer gives to the client the size and producer's pid using the argument list.
At this point, the parent starts writing in the named pipe. The child process starts reading.
In the shell, the time taken to transmit the whole data is shown.
