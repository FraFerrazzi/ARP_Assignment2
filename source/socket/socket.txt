SOCKET

The program aims to calculate the performance of transmitting data between processes using socket.
Sockets let two (or more) processes communicate. In our case, there is a server and a client.
The server is passive, creates the socket, and waits for the client which plugs into the server's socket.
The processes are on the same machine and connect each other using a defined port number and the local IP number. If the port number already assigned is taken, try to uncomment one of the port numbers already placed in the code.
After that, the server creates 1Mb of random data and reads from a file the size of the data that the user wants to transimt (1Mb to 100Mb).
At this point, the server starts writing using the socket communication. The client process reads.
In the shell, the time taken to transmit the whole data is shown.
