UNNAMED PIPE

The program aims to calculate the performance of transmitting data between processes using unnamed pipes.
At the beginning of the program three main parts take place:
1) initialize the unnamed pipe and make sure that works fine.
2) get the input from the user (1Mb to 100Mb).
3) create 1Mb of random data
After that, the father process forks and the child takes place. 
At this point, the parent starts writing in the unnamed pipe. The child process starts reading.
In the shell, the time taken to transmit the whole data is shown.
