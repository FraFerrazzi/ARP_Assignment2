SOCKET

The program aims to calculate the performance of transmitting data between processes using socket.
Sockets let two (or more) processes communicate. In our case, there is a server and a client.
The server is passive, creates the socket, and waits for the client which plugs into the server's socket.
The processes are on the same machine and connect each other using a defined port number and the local IP number. 
After that, the server creates the random data and takes a requested size of data from the user (1Mb to 100Mb). 
At this point, the server starts writing using the socket communication. The client process starts reading.
In the shell, the time taken to transmit the whole data is shown.
